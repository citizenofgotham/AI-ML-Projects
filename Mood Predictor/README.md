Mood Predictor

A simple Python program that predicts a mood (`happy`, `sad`, or `angry`) from a sentence using Naive Bayes and CountVectorizer from `scikit-learn`.  
This project demonstrates basic text classification and can be extended for more moods or larger datasets.

 ðŸ“Œ Features
- Converts text into numerical features for machine learning.  
- Uses a Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB) to learn from example sentences.  
- Predicts the mood of any input sentence.
